Basics of Classes in Python.

Before coding any class:

- Think about which kind of data do you want to represent with your class.
- Think about the base case of every instance.
- Think about the instance variables: What is unique (identifiers) about each instance.
- Think about the methods: What operations (actions) can be performed by each instance.
- Think about the printed representation of the instance.

- Defining a class:

	- class <class_name>:


Class Methods:

- Mandatory Parameter self: 

	- The class instance must be passed as an argument to all class methods, therefore it is
	  mandatory that all class methods receive at least one argument. Self is the standard 
	  name of this argument.


- Defining the constructor method: 
	
	- The constructor is automatically called each time a 
	  new instance of the class is created, it allows to set up class attributes 
	  that will provide the newly created instance with its initial state values.
		
		- def __init__(self, parameter1, parameterN):
			# the user can define initial state values by adding parameters (or arguments)
			# to the constructor and assigning them to and instance attribute.
			self.<instance_attribute1> = parameter1
			...
			self.<instance_attributeN> = parameterN
			# initial state values can also be set to a predefined value.
			self.<predefined_instance_attribute> = <some_value>

- Calling the constructor method:
	
	- Each time the constructor is called it creates a new objecto of the class <class_name>
	  and it sets up its initial state values. This process is called instantiation.
	  Naturally, each time the constructor is called  it creates a new instance of 
	  the class <class_name> and returns it as an object than can assigned to a variable.
	
	- Implementation:
		- <instance_name> = <class_name>()


- String representation Method:

	- The string representation method is used to override the Python default implementation
	  of representing an object as a string. It is normally useful when providing more
	  information about the initial state values of an instance.

	- Implementation:
		- def __str__(self):
			return <string>
