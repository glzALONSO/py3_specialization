Python Methods

Strings, Lists and Tuples:

Strings and Tuples are inmutable.
Lists are mutable.
Python is a 0-index.
Mutators changes an object.
Hybrids changes an object and returns a value.

- count(): count the ocurrences of a substring. Count the ocurrences of an item in a list
	Implementation:
		- string.count("substring")
		- list.count(<item>)

- index(): find the index of the first ocurrence of a substring.
	Implementation:
		-string.index("substring")
		-list.index(<item>)

- upper(): returns a copy in upper case letters.
	Implementation:
		-string.upper()

- lower(): returns a copy in lower case letters.
	Implementation:
		-string.lower()

- strip(): removes whitespaces(spaces, tabs, \n) at the begining and the end of the string.
	Implementation:
		-string.strip()

- split(): uses a delimiter to split the string into substrings. Returns a list of
	   substrings cutted at every instance of the delimiter, excluding the delimiter.
	   No arg --> delimiter = spaces
	 Implementation:
		-string.split("delimiter") --> delimiters examples: ". ", " "

- join(): merges a list of strings into a single string.
	Implementation:
		- joint.join(<list of string>) --> ";".join(["Hello", "World"])

- append(): adds an element to the end of a list.
	Implementation:
		-list.append("list_element")

- len(): returns an int indicating the number of elements in a list, string and dict.
	Implementation:
		- len(<list>)
		- len(<string>)
		- len(<dict>) --> number of key value pairs.

- type(): returns the type of something.
	Implementation:
		- type(<item>)

-list(): returns a list from an iterable.
	Implementation:
		- list(<iterable>)

- id(): returns the id of an object
	Implementation
		- id(<object>)

- insert(): insert an element into a list, this method does not replace any element.
	Implementation:
		- list.inster(<index>, <item>)

- reverse(): reverse the order of elements in the list
	Implementation:
		- list.reverse()
- sort(): reorders the elements in a list from smallest to biggest
	Implementation:
		- list.sort() --> strings sorted alphabetically

- sorted(): returns a new list with the values reordered from smallest to biggest without changing the original list.
	    Sequences of tuples are sorted based on the first elements, with ties being broken by the second elements and then third elements, etc.
	    Strings are sorted alphabetically. Numbers from smallest to biggest.
	Implementation:
		- sorted_sequence = sorted(<sequence>, reverse, key)
			- reverse parameter (boolean): True --> biggest to smallest
			- key parameter (function): 
				- applies the function to the unsorted list; sorting will be performed based on the resulting list.
				- when sorting a list of instances it is possible to pass an instance method that returns the value of an instance attribute; sorting will be performed based on such value.
			 
- remove(): removes all occurences of specific value from a list.
	Implementation:
		- list.remove(<value_to_be_removed>)

- pop(): removes the last item from the list and returns it
	Implementation:
		- list.pop()
		- list.pop(<index>) removes and return the item at the index.
- format(): formats a string.
	Implementation:
		- "string1 {} {}".format(string2, string3)
		- {:.2f}: when using float numbers. specify how many decimal places to use.

- map(): returns an iterable whose items are the elements from a sequence transformed by the transformation function.
	Implementation:
		- map(<transformer>, <sequence>) --> transformer should return a single value.

- filter(): return an iterable whose items are the elements from a sequence filtered by the filtration fuction.
	Implementation:
		- filter(<filter>, <sequence>) -- filter should return a boolean value

- LIST COMPREHENSIONS: 

- Mapping: [<transformer_expression> for <var_name> in <sequence>]
	Implementation:
		- [value * 2 for value in things]

- Filtering: [<transformer_expression> for <var_name> in <sequence> if <filter_expression>]
	Implementation:
		- [num for num in nums if num % == 0] --> <transformer expression> equal to <var_name> to avoid performing a transformation.

- Map and Filter: [<transformer_expression> for <var_name> in <sequence> if <filter_expression>]
	Implementation:
		- [x*2 for x in things if x % 2 == 0]
Files:

Relative paths start with ".." which means go up one level in the file structure.

file objects support iteration but not slicing

- open(): returns a file object
	Implementation:
		- file = open(<path>, action) --> action:
							- read: "r"
							- write: "w" creates a file when one does not exist. When exists deletes contents of the file.

- read(): read and return the contents of the entire file as a single string.
	Implementation:
		- file.read(<numbers of character>) --> no arg: all characters

- readline(): return a single line of the file up to and including \n. Returns sequantially when called multiple times.
	Implementation:
		- file.readline()

- readlines(): returns a list of strings containg all the lines in a file. delimiter --> \n
	Implementation:
		- file.readlines()

- write(): adds a string to the end of the file.
	Implementation:
		- file.write(<string\n>)

- close(): closes a file.
	Implementation:
		- file.close()

Dictionaries: 
Involve the computation of a hash function. 
When you copy a nested list, you do not also get copies of the internal lists.
Iterating over a dictionary implicitly iterates over the keys.

Assignment --> dict1[<key>] = <value>. Key is used to acces the value.

- keys():
	Implementation: returns an iterable containing the all the keys in the dict.
		- dict.keys()
		- list(dict.keys()) --> get the keys into a list.

- values(): returns an iterable containing the values in the dict.
	Implementation:
		- dict.values()

- items(): returns an iterable containing all the key-value pairs in the dict as tuples.
	Implementation:
		- dict.items()

- get(): returns the value of the key provided as argument.
	Implementation:
		- dict.get(<key>, <return_value>) --> if no second argument is provided, method returns None.

- sorted(): alphabetically sorts the keys of a dict.
	Implementation:
		- sorted(dict.keys())

- copy(): returns a copy of a dictionary.
	Implementation:
		- dict_copy = dict.copy()

- enumerate(): returns a tuple containing the index and the item in the sequence.
	Implementation:
		- enumerate(<sequence>) --> (index, item)

JSON Module: import json

Check the JSON editor online.

- loads(): takes a JSON-formatted string as input and produces a python object (a dictionary or a list) as output.
	Implementation:
		- json.loads(<JSON-formatted_string>)

- dumps():  takes a python object, typically a dictionary or a list, and returns a string, in JSON format.
	Implementation:
		- json.dumps(<python_object) --> sort_keys=True: keys of the output dict sorted alphabetically.
					     --> indent=<int>: provides a human-readeable string using indentation and newlines.


Copy Module: import copy

- deepcopy(): Return a deep copy. Deep copying is only relevant for compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or class instances)
	Implementation:
		-copy.deepcopy(<object>)


- copy(): Return a shallow copy.
	Implementation:
		-copy.copy(<object>) 


Requests Module:

- json(): extract the JSON Data contained in the responso Object obtained after a request by passing the contents of the .txt attribute to the json.loads().
	Implementation:
		- response.json()

- url: displays the full url generated from the input parameters.
	Implementation: 
		- response.url

- text: this attribute contains the contents of the file or other information available from the URL.
	Implementataion:
		- response.text

- get(base_url, params): send an HTTP GET request to the url provided as argument.
	Implementation:
		- request.get(<base_url>, params=dict) --> params must be a dictionary containing the key-value pairs that will be appended to the base url in order to perform the request.
