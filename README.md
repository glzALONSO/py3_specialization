# py3_specialization
Solutions to the py3 specialization projects

This repo contains solutions to the course projects of the Python 3 Programming Specialization offered by the University of Michigan in Coursera. The code is in a GitHub repo to make accesible to everyone. However, if you are a student of the specialization I highly encourage you to avoid plaigarism.
